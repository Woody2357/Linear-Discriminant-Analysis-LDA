# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-LDA
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (also known as Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA)) is a linear dimensional reduction method aiming at projecting data from different categories to a low-dimensional space so that the images of data from different categories are separated as much as possible.
