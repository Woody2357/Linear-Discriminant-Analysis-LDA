# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-LDA
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), also known as Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA), is a linear dimensionality reduction technique. It projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the separation between categories.

This repository applies LDA to the MNIST dataset for dimensionality reduction and compares its results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
